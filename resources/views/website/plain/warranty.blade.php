    <p class="h3 heading">Coverage</p>
    This limited <span class="roboto-bold">non-transferable</span> warranty covers machines, products and accessories
    sold in the USA by Ricoma International. For products that are purchased or located outside of the USA, Ricoma’s
    international one-year warranty will apply. Ricoma guarantees that the covered products will be free of defects in
    material or workmanship during the applicable warranty period stated below. Ricoma will, at its option, repair or
    replace a product that is found defective during the warranty period. Warranty work must be performed or authorized
    by a Ricoma Authorized Representative. If onsite warranty work is required on a new product within the first 90 days
    after receipt of product, Ricoma will cover all costs related to the service call including parts, labor and
    travel. After the initial 90 days, this <span class="roboto-bold">Warranty covers parts and labor only, and does not
        include travel expenses by Ricoma’s technicians for onsite work.</span> The customer is responsible for basic
    troubleshooting with a Ricoma technician before an onsite technician can or will be dispatched.

    <p class="h4 heading mt-3">Warranty</p>
    Ricoma’s <span class="roboto-bold">Warranty</span> applies for the warranty period specified for the specific
