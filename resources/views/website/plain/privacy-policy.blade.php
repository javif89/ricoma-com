<span class="roboto-bold" style="font-size: 22px;" id="one">1. Information We Collect</span>
<p><span class="roboto-bold">When You Visit our Websites</span></p>

    the Websites, we request that you provide Personal Information about yourself, and we collect Navigational
    Information.</p>
<p><span class="roboto-bold">"Personal Information" collected via online forms, trade shows, and phone calls</span>

    contact information, such as your name, e-mail address, company name, address, phone number, and other
    information about yourself or your business.
    Personal Information can also include information about any transactions, both free and paid, that you enter on
    the Websites, trade shows or provided over phone calls with our staff and information about you that is
    available on the internet, such as from Facebook,
    LinkedIn, Twitter and Google, or publicly available information that we acquire from service providers.
    Personal Information also includes Navigational Information or Payment Information where such information can
    directly or indirectly identify an individual. Navigational information refers to information about your
    computer and your visits to this website such

    Please see the "Navigation Information" section below. Payment information is collected through “Stripe”, which
    processes payment information from you including
    credit cards numbers, using third party PCI-compliant service providers. This information is only collected when
    you enter your credit card information voluntarily to make a purchase online. Except for this, we do not collect
    Sensitive Information from you online.</p>

    purposes, we do link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information such as name, email address,
    address, and phone number.</p><span class="roboto-bold">Information About Children</span>

    collect information about children under 16. If you believe that we have collected information about a child
    under 16, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@ricoma.us">info@ricoma.us</a>, so that we may delete the
    information.</p>
<p><span class="roboto-bold" style="font-size: 22px;" id="two">2. How We Use Information We Collect</span></p>

<p><span class="roboto-bold">Use of Personal Information (Performance of a Contract or Existing Customers)</span>
</p>

    required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</p>
<p><span class="roboto-bold">Legal basis for processing Personal Information (EEA visitors only)</span></p>
<p>If you are a visitor/customer located in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), our legal basis for collecting and
    using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the
    specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information from you only
    where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you,
    or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or
    fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal
    information from you.
    If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with
    you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal
    information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal
    information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate
    interests
    (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests
    are.</p>
<p><span class="roboto-bold">Use of Navigational Information</span></p>
<p>We use Navigational Information to operate and improve the Websites. We may also use Navigational Information
    alone or in combination with Personal Information to provide you with personalized information about Ricoma.</p>

<p>We post customer testimonials and comments on our Websites, which may contain Personal Information.</p>
<p><span class="roboto-bold">Video Testimonials</span></p>
<p>We obtain each customer's consent via paper form prior to filming the testimonial. Prior to filming, customers
    are required to give consent via a paper form with their printed name and signature.
    This form gives Ricoma consent to film them and use the footage and or photographs of themselves, their business
    and their employees on our Websites, social media accounts, publications, printed promotional
    materials, educational materials, email marketing and derivative works or for any similar purpose without
    further consent.</p>

    Facebook Business Page and related groups including “Ricoma Connect” and “Embroidery &amp;
    Custom Apparel Mastery, Google Reviews and Instagram are used for marketing purposes on our Websites and are
    promoted via email communications. At any time if you contact us directly at <a href="mailto:info@ricoma.us" class="">info@ricoma.us</a>
    and request that your comment or review be removed, Ricoma will remove it accordingly and will not use it again
    for any marketing purpose.</p>
<p><span class="roboto-bold">Use of Credit Card Information</span></p>
<p>If you give us credit card information, we use it solely to check your financial qualifications and collect
    payment from you. We use a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service
    provider
    is not permitted to store, retain, or use information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card
    processing on our behalf.</p>
<p><span class="roboto-bold">Security of your Personal Information</span></p>

    (for example, as long as is required in order to contact you about our other services, or as needed to comply
    with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements).
    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we securely delete the
    information or anonymise it or, if this is not possible, then we will securely store your Personal Information
    and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
    We will delete this information from the servers at an earlier date if you so request, as described in "To
