                    What comes with a Ricoma machine?
                    @endslot
                    <p>
                        We’ll answer this question with a question. What doesn’t come with a Ricoma machine?
                        Ricoma
                        is
                        one of the very rare embroidery machine companies that both manufacture and sell
                        their
                        products.
                        That means every Ricoma employee knows our embroidery machines inside and out. Our
                        certified
                        customer support staff is equipped to assist you 7 days a week (seriously, whenever
                        you need
                        a
                        hand they’re just a call or webcam session away.) Aside from being the manufacturers
                        and
                        offering unparalleled customer support, here is what to physically expect when you
                        go with
                        Ricoma.

                    What kind of support do I get with Ricoma?
                    @endslot
                    <p>
                        Ricoma technicians are available to you 7 days a week. When you’re starting off,
                        you’re
                        likely
                        running your machine during the weekends if you have other commitments during the
                        workweek.
                        We
                        understand that. That’s why, aside from having 7-day customer support, we also
                        provide
                        resources
                        such as training, manuals and how-to videos on our machines. We’re constantly
                        working on
                        material such as blogs, videos and webinars to help customers get started and
                        succeed in the
                        embroidery business.

                    <p>
                        Every Ricoma embroidery machine purchase includes free hands-on training either
                        online or at
                        our facility in Miami, Florida. If you purchase a 2-head or up, we'll come to your
                        location
                        for a free 2-day training. We’ll make sure you know exactly what you’re doing before
                        your
                        training session is over. But if you still want additional resources to keep
                        handy, we
                        also provide how-to videos and manuals.

                    What is the average delivery time for a Ricoma machine?
                    @endslot
                    <p>
                        We test and prepare our embroidery machines at our Miami, Florida, facility. It
                        takes about
                        a
                        week to test, crate and prepare our machines for shipping. Once your machine has
                        been
                        shipped,
                        transit times typically range from 2 to 5 business days depending on how close you
                        are to
                        our
                        facility.
